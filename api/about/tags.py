app_info={
    'info':"""Hello! My name is Notigram, and I am a token based API-bot ^^
    \nWhat do I mean by this? Well, here I can provide you with a unique token, which you can use to communicate with my api through an http request, or through my python module.
    \nThe request is simple. you send your token along with a message, and I'll immediately send it to you through Telegram.
    \nThis way you can set the request up inside a script, or as a terminal command, and get notifications on your phone every time an event happens, such as the end of a program, a milestone, or any other alert you could need to be notified about.
    \nTo install the Python module, just run:
    \n<code>python -m pip install notigram</code>
    \nAnd to use it, you can launch it from terminal as:
    \n<code>python -m notigram &lt;TOKEN&gt; &lt;message&gt;</code>
    \nOr instantiate it inside a code with:
    \n<code>from notigram import ping\nping('&lt;TOKEN&gt','message')</code>
    \n\nFor more info about usage, check the <a href="https://github.com/Rinngell-Rezs/notigram-CLI">repository page on Github</a>!
