    'info':"""Hello! My name is Notigram, and I am a token based API-bot ^^
    \nWhat do I mean by this? Well, here I can provide you with a unique token, which you can use to communicate with my api through an http POST request, or through my python module.
    \nThe request is simple. Just send your token along with a message, and I'll immediately send it back to you through Telegram.
    \nThis way you can set the request up inside a script, or as a terminal command, and get notifications on your phone every time an event happens, such as the end of a program, a milestone, a traceback, or any other alert you could need to be notified about while AFK.
    \n\nTo install the Python module, just run:
    \n<pre>python -m pip install notigram</pre>
    \nAnd to use it, you can launch it from terminal as:
    \n<pre>python -m notigram &lt;TOKEN&gt; &lt;message&gt;</pre>
    \nOr call it from inside a script with:
    \n<pre>from notigram import ping\nping('&lt;TOKEN&gt','message')</pre>
    \n\nFor more info about usage, check the <a href="https://github.com/Rinngell-Rezs/notigram-CLI">repository page on Github</a>!
